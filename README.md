# YegorIfThenElseSketch
This is a sketch I put together to illustrate a potential way to get ride of an IfThenElse block with polymorphism

The example is in Swift so a couple of reminders for Java programmers.

Protocols are essentially analogous to Interfaces
Contructors are init()

I think everything else is pretty self explanatory
