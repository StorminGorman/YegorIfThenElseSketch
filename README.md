# YegorIfThenElseSketch

[This is a sketch](https://github.com/StorminGorman/YegorIfThenElseSketch/blob/master/Talk.swift) 
I put together to illustrate a potential way to eliminate an IfThenElse block with polymorphism and decorators

The example is in Swift so here's a couple of reminders for Java programmers:

- Protocols are essentially analogous to Interfaces
- Contructors are init()
- Array types are [ObjectType]

I think everything else is pretty self explanatory
